    <h4 class="indextext"> The history of the Auto Exotic Motor Group:</h4>
    <p class="text00">
   
The Exotic Auto Motor Group was born when two ambitious brothers, started the first motor retailing company of its kind in South Africa. The A&E  outlet, situated in Bree Street in Johannesburg CBD, started trading in 1910.

The brothers provided general maintenance and repair services to the community then limited automotive drivers. In time their business started dealing in cars as well as servicing them. The following decades saw dramatic growth of the business, and before they knew it, the brothers had a company so big that larger corporations were taking note.

In 1949 A&E was taken over by the Bothner Group. After further expansion, the business was taken over by Stolly's Motor Group in 1956. 1974 saw yet another takeover when the Lonrho Group purchased the outlet known as Delta at the time.

Just before the turn of the century, the company was taken over by an independent group called Auto Exotic & Delta (Pty) Ltd. Just five years later, in 2004, Auto Exotic opened Umhlanga branch.

With such a rich history of excellent growth and dedication to service, Auto Exotic is still setting the standard of car services and dealerships across South Africa.</p>
